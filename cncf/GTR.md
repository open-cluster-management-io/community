## Day 0 - Planning Phase

### Scope

* **Describe the roadmap process, how scope is determined for mid to long term features, as well as how the roadmap maps back to current contributions and maintainer ladder?**

  The roadmap is managed in [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/open-cluster-management-io/projects/2). Issues are tagged as enhancements and placed in the backlog, with scope and priority discussed in bi-weekly community meetings. Enhancements involving API changes or multiple components require a formal proposal in the [enhancements repo](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/enhancements), including a graduation plan. Contributing a feature or enhancement is a common path to becoming a maintainer. See the [contributor ladder](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LADDER.md) for details.

* **Describe the target persona or user(s) for the project?**

  OCM is intended for use within a single organization managing a fleet of clusters where the hub operator has
  administrative authority over the fleet. Within that boundary, `ManagedClusterSet` provides isolation between
  teams or tenants, scoping their access to specific subsets of the fleet. Cross-organization or service-provider
  multi-tenancy, where independent organizations share a single hub, is not supported. Provisioning and lifecycle
  of clusters is also explicitly out of scope.

* **Explain the primary use case for the project. What additional use cases are supported by the project?**

  1. Administrators are able to manage and monitor multiple Kubernetes clusters in a centralized control plane
  2. Users are able to deploy their workload across multiple clusters.
  3. Users are able to define a cluster selection criteria to deploy different workloads.
  4. Users are able to easily extend the control plane by adding more management functionality across multiple clusters.

* **Explain which use cases have been identified as unsupported by the project.**

  Provisioning/lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters is not the scope of this project.

* **Describe the intended types of organizations who would benefit from adopting this project. (i.e. financial services, any software manufacturer, organizations providing platform engineering services)?**
  
  - Entities, e.g. financial institutions, internet companies, with many Kubernetes clusters.
  - Vendors that provide platform engineering services.
  - Not tied to any specific market segment. More details can be seen in [Adopters](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md).

* **Please describe any completed end user research and link to any reports.**

  - AppsCode held a webinar on "Managing Many Clusters using Open Cluster Management" on 15th June 2023.
  https://appscode.com/blog/post/monthly-review-june-2023/#managing-many-clusters-using-open-cluster-management
  - Alibaba published a document on their user experience with kubefed and why they moved to OCM on Sep 22, 2021.
  https://cloudnativenow.com/features/the-next-kubernetes-frontier-multicluster-management/ 

### Usability

* **How should the target personas interact with your project?**

  - [CLI](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/clusteradm): For users who have multiple clusters to manage, they
  use the clusteradm CLI tool to interact with OCM.io for deploying resources and managing clusters.

  - [SDK-GO](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/sdk-go) and [Addon-Framework](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework):
  For users who provide a cluster management platform, they use sdk-go and addon-framework to extend OCM.io’s capabilities.

  - **[APIs/CRDs](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/api)**: Users and platform builders interact directly with OCM’s custom resources, including `ClusterManager`, `Klusterlet`, `ManagedCluster`, and `ClusterManagementAddOn`, to configure and observe the hub-spoke topology. OCM’s entire API surface is covered by just four lightweight API groups, making it approachable and easy to integrate with, while remaining mature, proven, and tested. These APIs are the primary interface for automation and integration with other tools.

  - **[Helm](https://helm.sh/)**: OCM’s hub and spoke components can be installed and configured via official Helm charts, available at https://open-cluster-management.io/helm-charts.

* **Describe the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) of the project.**

  OCM's UX is mainly built around `clusteradm` and a collection of CRDs. A graphical interface is available via a [Headlamp](https://headlamp.dev/) plugin in the [lab repo](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/lab/tree/main/headlamp-plugin), reflecting OCM's approach of integrating with established open source tooling rather than building standalone UIs. The plugin is currently in alpha and not yet recommended for production use.

* **Describe how this project integrates with other projects in a production environment.**

  Some integration examples include:
  - [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Generators-Cluster-Decision-Resource/#how-it-works):
    OCM supplies Argo CD with ClusterDecision resources via Argo CD’s Cluster Decision Resource Generator, enabling it to
    select target clusters for GitOps deployments.
  - [Argo CD Agent](https://argocd-agent.readthedocs.io/latest/getting-started/ocm-io/): OCM deploys and manages Argo CD
    Agents in spoke clusters, enabling secure GitOps operations and lifecycle management across the fleet.
  - [Kueue](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-contrib/tree/main/kueue-addon): OCM integrates Kueue by installing
  a scheduler addon on managed clusters, providing unified batch workload scheduling and resource management across clusters.
  - [Fluid](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-contrib/tree/main/fluid-addon): OCM integrates Fluid by deploying
  its runtime via an addon, enabling distributed data caching and acceleration capabilities in managed clusters.
  - [Open-Telemetry](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-contrib/tree/main/open-telemetry-addon): OCM
  integrates Open-Telemetry by deploying its operator through an addon, allowing centralized observability and telemetry data
  collection across clusters.
  - [KubeVela](https://kubevela.io/docs/platform-engineers/system-operation/working-with-ocm/) uses OCM to deploy application
  over multiple clusters.
  - [KubeStellar](https://docs.kubestellar.io/release-0.28.0/direct/start-from-ocm/) uses OCM as the underlying multicluster
  management "Inventory and Transport Space".
  - [ICOS Meta OS](https://www.icos-project.eu/docs/Administration/ICOS%20Agent/Orchestrators/controlplane/) uses OCM as
  the multicluster management controlplane.

  The full list of adopters and integrations is available at [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md).

### Design

* **Explain the design principles and best practices the project is following.**

  - Hub-spoke architecture: the hub component is lightweight, letting users set instructions for spokes via the CRD mechanism. The spoke agent acts based on the hub’s instructions.
  - Extensible: the core components are kept as simple and lightweight as possible, with well-defined extension points to easily add customized functionality.
  - Pull-based model: spoke clusters pull desired state from the hub rather than the hub pushing directly into spokes. The hub
  holds no credentials for managed clusters and never initiates connections to them. This improves scalability, reduces the
  attack surface, and allows spoke clusters to operate independently if the hub becomes temporarily unavailable.

* **Outline or link to the project's architecture requirements? Describe how they differ for Proof of Concept, Development, Test and Production environments, as applicable.**

  The OCM architecture consists of a hub-spoke model documented at https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/concepts/architecture/.

  For different environments:
  - **Proof of Concept**: Single hub cluster with 1-3 spoke clusters, minimal resource allocation (2 CPU, 4GB RAM per hub component)
  - **Development**: Similar to PoC but with additional development addons and potentially multiple hub clusters for testing
  - **Test**: Multi-hub setup with various addon configurations to test different scenarios and upgrade paths
  - **Production**: High availability hub clusters with proper resource allocation, backup/restore procedures, and monitoring across potentially hundreds of managed clusters

* **Define any specific service dependencies the project relies on in the cluster.**

  OCM's only infrastructure dependency is a Kubernetes API server on the hub cluster, which it uses for CRD storage and control plane operations. OCM provides an implementation of the [Work API](https://multicluster.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/work-api/) defined by the CNCF SIG-Multicluster, ensuring interoperability with other multi-cluster tooling built against that spec. No external databases, message queues, or additional services are required.

* **Describe how the project implements Identity and Access Management.**

  OCM relies on Kubernetes-native identity and RBAC, giving administrators a familiar and standardized model out of the box with no proprietary IAM layer to learn or manage. Because OCM builds on Kubernetes' modular auth architecture, organizations can integrate their existing identity providers, such as OIDC or LDAP, exactly as they would with any Kubernetes cluster.

* **Describe how the project has addressed sovereignty.**

  OCM's pull-based architecture provides a natural foundation for sovereignty. Hubs never initiate connections to spokes and hold no spoke credentials. Spokes call the hub and can detach at will without loss of core workload functionality. This means hub clusters can be deployed centrally with spokes isolating themselves later, or hub clusters can be deployed regionally from the outset to support future data residency requirements.

* **Describe any compliance requirements addressed by the project.**

  OCM supports compliance use cases in two key ways. First, it provides centralized cluster inventory through the ManagedCluster API and implements the [Kubernetes ClusterInventory API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-inventory-api), giving operators an easy place to manage their whole fleet. Second, its policy addon enables centralized authoring and enforcement of compliance policies across all managed clusters, with support for Open Policy Agent and Kyverno. Details are documented at https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/integration/policy-controllers/

* **Describe the project’s High Availability requirements.**

  OCM control plane is based on the Kubernetes control plane. The controller of OCM hub and agent on the spoke cluster
  can run in multiple replicas with leader election.
  
  In addition, there is also a requirement that OCM hub clusters can be recovered upon disaster, which needs API
  backup/restore and agents’ connection switch among kubernetes clusters. How to meet this requirement is documented
  in https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/tree/main/solutions/multiplehubs

* **Describe the project’s resource requirements, including CPU, Network and Memory.**

  OCM has controllers on the hub cluster, and agents on spoke clusters. Resource requirements are configurable via the ClusterManager/Klusterlet APIs or using clusteradm; the minimums below reflect a default install with no addons enabled:

  | Deployment | Multi-node cluster | Single-node cluster |
  |---|---|---|
  | Hub (all controllers + operator) | ~100m CPU, ~500Mi memory | ~30m CPU, ~150Mi memory |
  | Spoke (Klusterlet agent) | ~20m CPU, ~150Mi memory | ~6m CPU, ~50Mi memory |

  These are minimums; actual usage scales with fleet size, ManifestWork volume, and addon activity. OCM requires the spoke cluster to be able to reach the hub cluster's API server directly or via HTTP proxy.

* **Describe the project’s storage requirements, including its use of ephemeral and/or persistent storage.**

  OCM uses CRDs to store API resources, it leverages kubernetes and underlying kubernetes etcd for data storage.

* **Please outline the project’s API Design:**
    * **Describe the project’s API topology and conventions**
  
      OCM has four API groups covering the core function areas of multicluster management:
      - Cluster lifecycle: `ManagedCluster`, `ManagedClusterSet`
      - Manifest delivery: `ManifestWork`
      - Scheduling: `Placement`, `PlacementDecision`
      - Addon lifecycle: `ManagedClusterAddon`, `ClusterManagementAddon`, `AddonTemplate`
      - Operator management: `ClusterManager`, `Klusterlet`

      The API design follows the API conventions defined at https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/api/blob/main/docs/api-conventions.md

    * **Describe the project defaults**

      OCM defaults include secure hub-spoke communication via mTLS, least-privilege RBAC, and automatic certificate rotation with 24-hour expiry.
      Default resource limits are set conservatively for hub components (500m CPU, 2Gi memory) and can be customized via ClusterManager/Klusterlet APIs.

    * **Outline any additional configurations from default to make reasonable use of the project**

      For production use, administrators should:
      - Configure high availability with multiple replicas for hub components
      - Set up proper resource requests/limits based on cluster scale
      - Enable addon frameworks for policy management, observability, and application lifecycle management
      - Configure backup/restore procedures for disaster recovery scenarios

    * **Describe any new or changed API types and calls \- including to cloud providers \- that will result from this project**
    being enabled and used

      OCM introduces several CRDs in the cluster.open-cluster-management.io API group:
      - ManagedCluster, ManagedClusterSet for cluster lifecycle
      - ManifestWork for resource deployment to managed clusters
      - Placement, PlacementDecision for cluster selection and scheduling
      - ManagedClusterAddon, ClusterManagementAddon for addon lifecycle
      OCM does not make direct calls to cloud providers - it operates through standard Kubernetes APIs.

      In addition, each klusterlet (spoke agent) establishes a persistent outbound connection to the hub cluster's API server. No inbound connections from the hub to spokes are required.

    * **Describe compatibility of any new or changed APIs with API servers, including the Kubernetes API server**

      All OCM APIs are implemented as standard Kubernetes CRDs. OCM is tested against Kubernetes 1.24 and newer and
      requires a Kubernetes API server with support for CRDs, CertificateSigningRequests, and RBAC. Compatibility
      is validated against multiple Kubernetes distributions as part of the release process; versions or distributions
      outside this tested range are not guaranteed to work.

    * **Describe versioning of any new or changed APIs, including how breaking changes are handled**

      A new or changed API would introduce an API version upgrade which would need API migration taking more than 1 release.
      The document https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/api/blob/main/docs/development.md#api-upgrade-flow describes
      the general flow we follow for API upgrades.

    * **Describe the project’s release processes, including major, minor and patch releases.**

      OCM follows the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/), using a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format where version numbers convey meaning about the underlying changes. Minor releases happen approximately every three to four months, with patch releases following roughly a month after each minor release. Additional patch releases may be issued for critical security fixes. For full details of the release process, including cadence, planning, and community involvement, see https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/community/blob/main/RELEASE.md

### Installation

* **Describe how the project is installed and initialized, e.g. a minimal install with a few lines of code or does it require more complex integration and configuration?**

  The project can be installed in minutes using a command-line tool for a minimal setup, while also offering more configurable installation methods for production environments.
  The detailed installation doc is [here](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/quick-start/).

  A minimal install, which sets up a hub cluster and registers a spoke cluster, is achieved with the clusteradm CLI tool. This provides a "few lines of code" experience:
  Initialize the Hub Cluster: On your designated hub cluster, run:
  ```
  clusteradm init
  ```
  Join the Spoke Cluster: On your spoke cluster, use the token from the previous step to install the agent and register:
  ```
  clusteradm join --hub-token <token-from-previous-command> --hub-apiserver <hub-server-url> --cluster-name <my-spoke-cluster>
  ```
  Accept the Spoke Cluster: On your hub cluster, accept the spoke cluster joining request:
  ```
  clusteradm accept --clusters <my-spoke-cluster>
  ```
  For more complex production integrations, we provide official Helm charts that allow for detailed configuration of
  ingress, high availability, resource requirements, and other enterprise-grade settings.
  ```
  helm repo add ocm https://open-cluster-management.io/helm-charts
  helm repo update
  helm search repo ocm
  helm install
  ```

  * **Install cluster manager**

  ```bash
  helm install cluster-manager  --version <version> ocm/cluster-manager --namespace=open-cluster-management --create-namespace
  ```

  * **Install klusterlet**

  ```bash
  helm install klusterlet --version <version> ocm/klusterlet \
  --set klusterlet.clusterName=<cluster name> \
  --set-file bootstrapHubKubeConfig=<the bootstrap kubeconfig file of hub cluster> \
  --namespace=open-cluster-management \
  --create-namespace
  ```

  OCM includes an [addon framework](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-framework) that provides a consistent way to activate built-in addons and develop new ones. Addons are opt- in — none are active by default — keeping the install lightweight and reducing the attack surface.

  A set of first-party addons is installable via `clusteradm install hub-addon --names <addon>`, including `argocd`, `argocd-agent`, and `governance-policy-framework`. These are maintained as sub-projects under the `open-cluster-management-io` GitHub organization, each with their own release cadence and maintainer list, and follow the same contributor ladder and governance model as the core project. Community addons are available at https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/addon-contrib.

* **How does an adopter test and validate the installation?**

  An adopter can test and validate the installation through a series of checks and a simple end-to-end test:
  Verify Agent and Controller Status:
  On the hub cluster, check that the OCM controller pods are running:
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n open-cluster-management
  kubectl get pods -n open-cluster-management-hub
  ```
  On the spoke cluster, check that the Klusterlet agent pods are running:
  ```
  kubectl get pods -n open-cluster-management
  kubectl get pods -n open-cluster-management-agent
  ```

  Validate Cluster Registration: The most important validation is ensuring the spoke cluster has successfully
  registered with the hub.

  On the hub cluster, run the following command. The output should list your spoke cluster with a Managed status
  of true and an Available status that becomes true after a minute.
  ```
  kubectl get managedclusters
  ```

  Perform an End-to-End Workload Test: To confirm the entire system is working, deploy a simple application from
  the hub to the spoke:
  - Create a ManifestWork YAML file on the hub that defines a simple workload (e.g., an Nginx deployment) and targets
  your managed cluster.
  - Apply it to the hub: `kubectl apply -f my-manifest-work.yaml`
  - Check the status of the ManifestWork on the hub to ensure it was applied successfully.
  - Finally, connect to the spoke cluster and verify that the Nginx pod is running (kubectl get pods). This confirms
  that the hub can successfully dispatch work to the managed cluster.

### Security

* **Please provide a link to the project’s cloud native [security self assessment](https://tag-security.cncf.io/community/assessments/).**

Self-assessment: https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/blob/main/SELF_ASSESSMENT.md

* **Please review the [Cloud Native Security Tenets](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/community/resources/security-whitepaper/secure-defaults-cloud-native-8.md) from TAG Security.**
    * **How are you satisfying the tenets of cloud native security projects?**
  
      - Managed clusters isolation: Components running on a managed cluster are restricted to accessing only their own resources on the hub, preventing
      unauthorized interactions between clusters.
      - Managed clusters credential free: The hub cluster does not need/store the managed clusters credentials.
      - Double Opt-In Handshake for Cluster Registration: A mutual authentication process during cluster registration, requiring explicit approval from
      both the hub and the managed cluster.

    * **Describe how each of the cloud native principles apply to your project.**

      - Secure by Default: OCM establishes a secure communication channel between the hub and spoke clusters using mutual TLS (mTLS).
      The registration process ensures that only authenticated and authorized spoke clusters (via a bootstrap token and subsequent certificate signing)
      can connect to the hub. No insecure ports are exposed, and all API interactions are subject to Kubernetes RBAC.
      - Least Privilege: The principle of least privilege is deeply embedded in OCM's architecture. The agent running on
      a managed cluster, known as the Klusterlet, operates with the minimal set of permissions required for its core functions.
      It can apply most kubernetes resources as defined by ManifestWork objects dispatched from the hub, others CustomeResourceDefinition
      to be managed need the user to grant permission explicitly. And any additional permissions needed for add-on features, such as policy
      inspection or application monitoring, must be granted explicitly through separate, scoped ClusterRoleBindings. This prevents the agent
      from having overly broad permissions and limits the potential impact of a compromise.
      - Defense in Depth: OCM employs a multi-layered security model:
      - Network: mTLS encrypts and authenticates all hub-spoke traffic.
      - API: Kubernetes RBAC on both the hub and spoke clusters controls access to all OCM resources.
      - Workload: OCM agents and add-ons run in dedicated namespaces with scoped ServiceAccounts.
      - Never Trust, Always Verify (Zero Trust): The hub and spoke clusters operate on a zero-trust model. A spoke cluster must go
      through a secure registration and certificate approval process. Every API request from the Klusterlet to the hub is authenticated
      via its client certificate, and every dispatch of work from the hub to the spoke is verified and applied by the agent based on its specific permissions.
      - Security as Code: The entire desired state of the managed fleet—including workload deployments, configurations, and
      security RBAC resources(role, rolebinding)—is represented by declarative Kubernetes-style API objects (ManifestWork, Placement).
      This enables users to manage their fleet’s security posture through GitOps workflows, providing versioning, auditing, and automated control.

    * **How do you recommend users alter security defaults in order to "loosen" the security of the project? Please link to any documentation the project has written concerning these use cases.**
  
      We do not recommend or document methods to "loosen" the security of the project, as our defaults are designed to be secure. However,
      OCM is highly configurable; in some cases, users need to grant Klusterlet agent permissions to manage their resources. We recommend users
      only grant permissions with the least privilege, referencing the documentation permission setting for work agent. For purposes like testing, users
      can grant sufficient privileges to the Klusterlet agent that could intentionally create a less secure configuration.

      These actions require deliberate and explicit configuration by a cluster administrator. Our documentation focuses on how to configure
      RBAC for specific use cases, not on how to weaken security.

* **Security Hygiene**
    * **Please describe the frameworks, practices and procedures the project uses to maintain the basic health and security of the project.**

      The OCM project maintains strong security hygiene through several automated and procedural safeguards:
      - Vulnerability Scanning: We enabled GitHub security scanning to scan our code for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) automatically.
      - Dependency Management: We use Dependabot to monitor our Go module and container base image dependencies, automatically
      creating pull requests for security updates.
      - Secure Coding Practices: All code submissions require pull requests with reviews from CODEOWNERS. Branch protection
      rules are enabled to enforce these reviews and require CI checks to pass before merging.
      - Private Vulnerability Reporting: We maintain a security page with a clear, private process for security researchers
      to report vulnerabilities to the project maintainers.

    * **Describe how the project has evaluated which features will be a security risk to users if they are not maintained by the project?**

    The ManifestWork API feature was designed to dispatch/manage Kubernetes resources on the managed cluster. Since it can dispatch/manage any resources,
    the work-agent might need wide permissions for the managed clusters. To mitigate the risk, we ensured that:
    - The agent on the spoke cluster to apply the manifests has admin permission, instead of cluster-admin, so that it can apply most Kubernetes resources.
    - For some specific resources, like some CustomResourceDefinitions, users need to explicitly grant permission to the work agent referencing the documentation permission setting for work agent
    - Users can delegate manifest application to a specific identity on the spoke cluster, further sandboxing the operation, see dynamic identity authorization.

* **Cloud Native Threat Modeling**
    * **Explain the least minimal privileges required by the project and reasons for additional privileges.**
  
      OCM requires a minimal set of privileges on both the hub and the managed cluster to function.

      On the Hub Cluster (during registration):
      - Permission to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to obtain a client certificate for secure communication.
      - Permission to read the secret containing the bootstrap credentials.

      On the Hub Cluster (post-registration):
      - Permission to watch ManifestWork objects within its dedicated cluster namespace.
      - Permission to create events and update its ManagedCluster status.
      - Permission to create/update leases for heartbeating.

      On the Managed Cluster:
      - Permission to apply/manage the resources specified in a ManifestWork. This is the most powerful permission and is the core of OCM's functionality.
      - Additional privileges are required only for OCM add-ons, which run as separate agents. For instance, the policy add-on needs permissions
      to inspect various resources on the managed cluster to check for compliance. These privileges are granted explicitly when the add-on is
      enabled and are scoped to the add-on's specific ServiceAccount.

    * **Describe how the project is handling certificate rotation and mitigates any issues with certificates.**
  
      OCM implements automatic, seamless certificate rotation for the Klusterlet agent and the addons’ agents.
      The client certificate used by the Klusterlet/addon to authenticate with the hub has a 24-hours expiry.

      The Klusterlet continuously monitors its own certificate. When a predefined threshold is met (e.g., 80% of its lifetime has passed), it will:
      - Generate a new private key on the managed cluster.
      - Create a new CSR on the hub cluster.
      - The hub’s registration controller automatically approves this CSR for a known and valid cluster.
      - The Klusterlet retrieves the newly signed certificate and begins using it for all communication.
      - This automated process mitigates the risk of cluster communication failure due to expired certificates and requires no manual intervention.

    * **Describe how the project is following and implementing [secure software supply chain best practices](https://project.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/CNCF\_SSCP\_v1.pdf)**

      OCM is committed to securing its software supply chain and aligns with the best practices outlined by the CNCF.
      - Secure Source Code: We enforce DCO sign-offs on all commits and use protected branches with mandatory PR reviews from official maintainers in our GitHub organization.
      - Secure Builds: Our build pipelines run in isolated, ephemeral environments via GitHub Actions. All build and release processes are defined as code within the repository, ensuring they are transparent and auditable.
      - Secure Artifacts:
        - Digital Signatures and Attestations: Release artifacts are signed via Sigstore using GitHub's OIDC-based attestation framework (keyless signing through Fulcio, with entries recorded in the Rekor transparency log). Helm charts additionally carry SLSA build provenance (`actions/attest-build-provenance`). Attestations can be verified with `gh attestation verify` or any Sigstore-compatible client, including `cosign verify-attestation`, allowing users to confirm that the artifacts they deploy were produced by our official build pipeline and have not been tampered with.
        - Software Bill of Materials (SBOM): We generate a SPDX-formatted SBOM for every container image we release (`anchore/sbom-action`) and attach it to the image as a signed in-toto attestation (`actions/attest-sbom`), pushed to the registry alongside the image. This provides a verifiable inventory of all software components and their dependencies.

      All official container images are uploaded to https://quay.io/organization/open-cluster-management with security scanning enabled.
      All charts are uploaded to https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?org=open-cluster-management&sort=relevance&page=1, which provides the community with a trusted, versioned, and verifiable source to deploy the OCM components,
      ensuring they are using official project artifacts.

## Day 1 - Installation and Deployment Phase

### Project Installation and Configuration

* **Describe what project installation and configuration look like. - Install doc: https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/installation/ - Install cluster manager: https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/tree/main/deploy/cluster-manager/chart/cluster-manager - Install klusterlet: https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/blob/main/deploy/klusterlet/chart/klusterlet/README.md**

### Project Enablement and Rollback

* **How can this project be enabled or disabled in a live cluster? Please describe any downtime required of the control plane or nodes.**

  OCM is installed as a control plane component, not toggled as a feature within an existing workload. It is enabled by installing ClusterManager on the hub via `clusteradm init` or Helm, and on each spoke by installing Klusterlet via `clusteradm join` or Helm — no control plane or node downtime is required.

  To fully uninstall OCM from the hub, detach all managed clusters first, then run `clusteradm clean`. Full steps: [Uninstall OCM from the control plane](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/installation/start-the-control-plane/#uninstalling-ocm-from-the-control-plane).

  The connection between hub and spoke can also be cut independently without full uninstall: [Cluster removal](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/concepts/cluster-inventory/managedcluster/#cluster-removal).

  When a `ManagedCluster` resource is deleted, spoke resources deployed via ManifestWork are cleaned up automatically. This is controlled by the `ResourceCleanup` feature gate — disabled by default in v0.16 and earlier, enabled by default from v0.17+. Without it, resources may be orphaned on the spoke. See [Resource cleanup when the managed cluster is deleted](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/installation/register-a-cluster/#resource-cleanup-when-the-managed-cluster-is-deleted).

  A spoke can also lose hub connectivity temporarily — for example, in an air-gapped or intermittently connected environment — without requiring uninstallation. OCM's pull-based architecture is designed for this: the Klusterlet continues running existing workloads on the spoke, the hub marks the cluster status `Unknown` when the heartbeat lease expires, and the Klusterlet automatically reconnects and re-syncs when the hub becomes reachable again.

* **Describe how enabling the project changes any default behavior of the cluster or running workloads.**

  Enabling OCM doesn't touch your existing workloads — it simply adds ClusterManager on the hub and Klusterlet on each spoke, each running in their own dedicated namespaces (`open-cluster-management` and `open-cluster-management-agent`).

  **ManifestWork is the unit of work — and it's a clean design.** Rather than syncing arbitrary resources from the hub, OCM's work-agent watches exclusively for `ManifestWork` objects in each cluster's dedicated namespace and applies the wrapped resources to the spoke. Anything else you put in that namespace — a raw ConfigMap, a Deployment — stays put on the hub. Nothing leaks accidentally to a spoke.

  The cluster namespace itself is worth calling out: each managed cluster gets its own namespace on the hub (named after the cluster), and it's a first-class control plane space. It holds the `ManifestWork` objects (the actual work to dispatch), `Lease` objects (Klusterlet heartbeat), connection `Secret`s, and addon resources (`ManagedClusterAddOn`, addon agent secrets). This namespace carries the primary per-cluster coordination state — intentional, auditable, and scoped. Registration and certificate rotation additionally use the cluster-scoped CSR API and the cluster-scoped `ManagedCluster` resource, so the namespace is not the only hub-spoke interface.

  See: [ManifestWork](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/concepts/manifestwork/) and [Deploy Kubernetes resources to managed clusters](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/scenarios/deploy-kubernetes-resources/).

* **Describe how the project tests enablement and disablement.**

  The project maintains integration tests for both ClusterManager and Klusterlet lifecycle covering enablement and disablement:

  - **ClusterManager** (`test/integration/operator/clustermanager_test.go`): Tests verify that hub components (deployments, RBAC, webhooks) are created on `ClusterManager` creation and removed on deletion.
  - **Klusterlet** (`test/integration/operator/klusterlet_test.go`): Tests verify that spoke components (registration and work agents, CRDs, RBAC) are created on `Klusterlet` creation and cleaned up on deletion.
  - **ManagedCluster deletion** (`test/integration/registration/managedcluster_deletion_test.go`): Tests verify that when a `ManagedCluster` is deleted, all associated `ManagedClusterAddOns` and `ManifestWorks` are removed in priority order before the cluster namespace is released.

  **[MORE INPUT NEEDED]** Two specific behaviors need explicit confirmation:
  1. When `ClusterManager` is removed, are all managed cluster namespaces on the hub cleaned up as part of that operation, or does that require prior explicit cluster detachment?
  2. When `Klusterlet` is removed from the spoke independently of deleting the `ManagedCluster` resource on the hub, are ManifestWork-deployed resources on the spoke cleaned up or orphaned?

* **How does the project clean up any resources created, including CRDs?**

  **CRDs:** `clusteradm clean` deletes the `ClusterManager` CR (triggering the operator to remove all hub components — deployments, webhooks, RBAC) and, with `--purge-operator`, removes the `clustermanagers.operator.open-cluster-management.io` CRD and the operator deployment itself.

  **[MORE INPUT NEEDED]** Whether the OCM API CRDs (`managedclusters`, `manifestworks`, `placements`, etc.) are removed as part of `clusteradm clean` or require explicit manual deletion should be confirmed and documented explicitly.

  **ManifestWork cleanup — the project provides tooling to prevent orphaning.** `clusteradm unjoin` (the recommended spoke removal command) proactively checks for `AppliedManifestWork` resources on the spoke before proceeding. If any exist, it names them, warns that they must be cleaned up manually because uninstalling the Klusterlet would leave that work unmanaged, and exits without removing anything ([`pkg/cmd/unjoin/exec.go`](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/clusteradm/blob/main/pkg/cmd/unjoin/exec.go)).

  This guard exists because bypassing it has cascading consequences: if the `Klusterlet` CR is deleted directly, the work-agent is gone and the `manifest-work-cleanup` finalizer on ManifestWork can never be cleared — causing ManagedCluster deletion on the hub to block indefinitely. Recovery requires manual finalizer removal and namespace cleanup, which is impractical at scale.

  The recommended sequence is therefore: delete `ManagedCluster` from the hub first, then run `clusteradm unjoin` on the spoke. Hub-side deletion is what removes the `ManagedClusterAddOn` and `ManifestWork` resources in the cluster namespace, which in turn allows the spoke's `AppliedManifestWork` resources to drain — so the `unjoin` guard above passes. Running `unjoin` first simply stops with the warning while work is still applied.

  This depends on the `ResourceCleanup` feature gate described earlier: enabled by default from v0.17+, disabled by default in v0.16 and earlier. On versions where it is not enabled, hub-side deletion will not clean the spoke automatically and the `AppliedManifestWork` resources must be removed manually before `unjoin` will proceed. Direct `Klusterlet` CR deletion is technically possible but not advised and unsupported at scale.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

* **How does the project intend to provide and maintain compatibility with infrastructure and orchestration management tools like Kubernetes and with what frequency?**

  We upgrade the k8s.io dependencies to the latest version in each release, for example: https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/blob/v1.0.0/go.mod#L30-L39

* **Describe how the project handles rollback procedures.**

  OCM handles rollbacks the same as upgrades, but needs to specify a lower version: https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/administration/upgrading/

* **How can a rollout or rollback fail? Describe any impact to already running workloads.**

  If a rollout or rollback fails, the spoke cluster may lose connection with the hub and cannot be managed anymore. The already running
  workloads will keep running, but will not be managed by the hub and their status will not be reported back to the hub.

* **Describe any specific metrics that should inform a rollback.**

  The primary rollback signal is the `ManagedCluster` status condition (`ManagedClusterConditionAvailable`): a cluster transitioning to `Available=False` or `Unknown` after an upgrade indicates a connectivity or agent failure requiring attention. `clusteradm` commands can also be used to verify cluster state post-upgrade: see [Upgrading your OCM environment](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/administration/upgrading/).

  This condition is a signal, not a rollback policy in itself. `Unknown` is set when the Klusterlet heartbeat lease expires, which also occurs during transient network loss and during the agent's own restart in a rolling upgrade — so a single cluster flipping state is expected and is not grounds for rollback. OCM does not prescribe a threshold; adopters should set their own based on fleet size, allowing the condition to persist beyond the lease duration and correlating across a meaningful proportion of the fleet, and confirming hub component health before concluding the upgrade itself is at fault.

  OCM is not opinionated about monitoring tooling — it exposes cluster health through its Kubernetes API conditions and leaves operators free to connect their preferred observability stack. The project documents one such integration using OpenTelemetry Collector and Prometheus: see [Monitoring OCM](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/administration/monitoring/). Distribution providers may expose additional named metrics on top of this foundation.

* **Explain how upgrades and rollbacks were tested and how the upgrade-\>downgrade-\>upgrade path was tested.**

  OCM components are upgraded with `clusteradm upgrade clustermanager --bundle-version=<version>` on the hub and `clusteradm upgrade klusterlet --bundle-version=<version>` on each spoke. Done manually, the upgrade is two steps per cluster and both are required: update the image on the operator Deployment, then update the image fields on the custom resource itself — `registrationImagePullSpec`, `workImagePullSpec` and `placementImagePullSpec` on `ClusterManager`, and `registrationImagePullSpec` and `workImagePullSpec` on `Klusterlet`. Updating the operator Deployment alone leaves the operands at the old version and produces mixed-version components. See [Upgrading your OCM environment](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/administration/upgrading/). The project follows semver conventions, and the API upgrade flow is documented at [API upgrade flow](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/api/blob/main/docs/development.md#api-upgrade-flow). Downgrade is supported by specifying a lower version target with the same tooling.

  Resources already applied to spokes keep running across a hub upgrade — the pull-based model means a spoke does not depend on hub availability to keep serving what it has already received. What does pause for the duration is anything that requires the hub: new or changed `ManifestWork` is not delivered, reconciliation of existing work against hub state does not occur, and status does not report back until the agent can reach the hub again.

  **[MORE INPUT NEEDED]** The upgrade→downgrade→upgrade path is not explicitly covered in the current CI workflows (which test at a single version). Maintainers should confirm whether this path is tested manually, in a separate pipeline, or whether API compatibility guarantees make it implicitly safe — and document the answer explicitly.

* **Explain how the project informs users of deprecations and removals of features and APIs.**

  Deprecations and removals are communicated via community issues, the roadmap, community meetings, and Slack. API version tags (`v1alpha1`, `v1alpha2`, `v1beta1`) are also updated as APIs progress through their lifecycle, giving users a versioned signal of stability and planned changes. The full API upgrade flow is documented at [API upgrade flow](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/api/blob/main/docs/development.md#api-upgrade-flow).

* **Explain how the project permits utilization of alpha and beta capabilities as part of a rollout.**

  The project follows the API upgrade flow https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/api/blob/main/docs/development.md#api-upgrade-flow to rollout from alpha to beta.
  Feature gates from alpha to beta follow a standard lifecycle:
  https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/administration/featuregates/ 


## Day 2 \- Day-to-Day Operations Phase

### Scalability/Reliability

* **Describe how the project increases the size or count of existing API objects.**

  For each managed cluster, OCM creates: one `ManagedCluster` resource on the hub, one dedicated namespace (named after the cluster), one Secret for the agent connection, and one additional Secret per enabled addon. These are the baseline hub-side objects per cluster and scale linearly with fleet size.

  ManifestWork objects are created in the cluster namespace to dispatch workloads to the spoke. There is no requirement for a single ManifestWork per workload — operators and addons may create multiple ManifestWorks per cluster (the recommended limit is 100 per managed cluster to avoid hub resource exhaustion). Each ManifestWork wraps one or more Kubernetes manifests, keeping the total object count on the hub bounded relative to the number of distinct workloads being dispatched.

  Addons follow the same pattern: each enabled addon may create ManifestWork objects in the cluster namespace to push addon agent resources to the spoke. The `ManagedClusterAddOn` resource on the hub tracks addon status per cluster.

* **Describe how the project defines Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs).**

  OCM's SLIs are expressed as Kubernetes status conditions:
  - Cluster availability: `ManagedClusterConditionAvailable` on each `ManagedCluster` resource
  - ManifestWork success: ManifestWork `.status.conditions` (`Applied`, `Available`)
  - Addon availability: `ManagedClusterAddOn` status conditions per cluster

  For Prometheus-based monitoring, standard Kubernetes API server metrics can be filtered to OCM resource types. This is documented in the [Monitoring OCM](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/administration/monitoring/) guide alongside a Grafana dashboard for visualisation.

  **[MORE INPUT NEEDED]** Maintainers should confirm whether named application-level Prometheus metrics (e.g. for cluster availability or ManifestWork success rates) are planned for upstream OCM, and document them here once available.

* **Describe any operations that will increase in time covered by existing SLIs/SLOs.**

  Operations that increase SLI/SLO time coverage include:
  - Adding more managed clusters, which increases the time to collect status from all clusters
  - Deploying large ManifestWorks with many resources, extending application deployment times
  - Running addon operations across many clusters simultaneously, affecting addon availability metrics
  - Certificate rotation operations across the fleet, temporarily impacting cluster connectivity SLIs

* **Describe the increase in resource usage in any components as a result of enabling this project, to include CPU, Memory, Storage, Throughput.**

  The hub baseline requirements are already documented (4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM minimum for production). Incremental cost per additional managed cluster is driven by: one persistent Klusterlet connection to the hub API server, one `ManagedCluster` resource and namespace, heartbeat lease renewals, and ManifestWork reconciliation traffic — scaling with ManifestWork and addon count rather than being a fixed per-cluster figure.

  The project provides a performance testing framework for measuring actual resource usage against a given workload profile: [multicluster-controlplane performance tests](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/multicluster-controlplane/tree/main/test/performance).

  **[MORE INPUT NEEDED]** Maintainers should publish measured per-cluster incremental CPU/memory numbers from the performance framework — even as a range at 100, 500, and 1000 clusters — so operators can right-size their hub before deployment.

* **Describe which conditions enabling / using this project would result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)**

  If extreme large number of clusters are registered into the hub cluster, or extreme large number of ManifestWorks are created on
  the hub cluster. It may cause large memory usage in kube-apiserver with too many CRs created and also result in resource exhaustion
  in etcd.

* **Describe the load testing that has been performed on the project and the results.**

  Load testing was performed using the [multicluster-controlplane performance testing framework](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/multicluster-controlplane/tree/main/test/performance). The default test configuration creates 1000 simulated clusters and generates 5 `ManifestWork` resources per cluster — `ManifestWork` being the primary unit of load, as it drives hub storage, reconciliation, and spoke delivery. The framework supports customisable ManifestWork payloads to simulate real-world workload sizes.

  Test results are recorded in a [shared results document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11GcIXAxPpQlu35VWnN5sVtqrtkM0EYm3rqj8sTz2Pvs/edit#gid=0). The derived limits (3000 clusters per hub, 100 ManifestWorks per cluster) are based on these results combined with production adopter feedback.

* **Describe the recommended limits of users, requests, system resources, etc. and how they were obtained.**

  Based on performance testing and community feedback, recommended limits include:
  - Maximum 3000 managed clusters per hub cluster (based on performance testing results)
  - Maximum 100 ManifestWorks per managed cluster to avoid resource exhaustion
  - Hub cluster minimum requirements: 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM for production workloads
  - Network bandwidth: 10Mbps minimum per 100 managed clusters for status reporting
  These limits were obtained through the performance testing framework and real-world production deployments by adopters.

  Network usage beyond the baseline status reporting figure is highly conditional on workload — ManifestWork size, reconciliation frequency, addon activity, and certificate rotation traffic all contribute. For real-world sizing, community consultation is recommended: adopters with production deployments have shared operational experience in the community channels and [ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md).

* **Describe which resilience pattern the project uses and how, including the circuit breaker pattern.**

  OCM implements several resilience patterns:
  - **Leader Election**: Hub controllers use leader election to ensure high availability and prevent split-brain scenarios
  - **Retry with Exponential Backoff**: Failed operations are retried with increasing delays to handle transient failures
  - **Graceful Degradation**: When hub cluster is unreachable, managed clusters continue running existing workloads
  - **Health Checks and Heartbeating**: Klusterlet agents regularly report health status and automatically reconnect on failures
  - **Certificate Auto-Rotation**: Automatic certificate renewal prevents authentication failures
  - **Pull-based Architecture**: Eliminates dependency on hub-to-spoke connectivity, improving resilience to network partitions


### Observability Requirements

* **Describe the signals the project is using or producing, including logs, metrics, profiles and traces. Please include supported formats, recommended configurations and data storage.**

  OCM produces the following signals:
  - **Logs**: Standard Kubernetes controller logs from ClusterManager and Klusterlet components, accessible via `kubectl logs` or any log aggregation stack.
  - **Metrics**: OCM does not ship a metrics endpoint of its own. Hub and spoke health is observable through Kubernetes API server metrics filtered to OCM resource types, and through `ManagedCluster`, `ManifestWork`, and `ManagedClusterAddOn` status conditions.
  - **Traces**: Not currently supported natively.

  For richer observability, OCM documents an optional integration using the OpenTelemetry Collector addon combined with Prometheus and Grafana: [Monitoring OCM](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/administration/monitoring/). This addon-based approach is optional — operators can observe OCM health without it using the Kubernetes status conditions and API server metrics described above.

* **Describe how the project captures audit logging.**

  Audit logging can be obtained from kube-apiserver audit log.

* **Describe any dashboards the project uses or implements as well as any dashboard requirements.**

  OCM has an experimental [Headlamp](https://headlamp.dev/) plugin available in the [lab repo](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/lab/tree/main/headlamp-plugin). It is in alpha and not recommended for production use.

* **Describe how the project surfaces project resource requirements for adopters to monitor cloud and infrastructure costs, e.g. FinOps**

  `ManagedCluster` status surfaces capacity information from each spoke (CPU, memory, and storage as reported by the spoke's node resources), giving operators a fleet-wide inventory view of cluster capacity through the Kubernetes API.

  OCM does not currently provide native FinOps or cost attribution tooling. For resource consumption monitoring, operators bring their own stack — OCM's addon framework makes it straightforward to deploy monitoring agents consistently across the fleet via ManifestWork.

* **Which parameters is the project covering to ensure the health of the application/service and its workloads?**
  
  OCM tracks the delivery of work to managed clusters via `ManifestWork` status conditions (`Applied`, `Available`) — these confirm that resources were successfully applied to the spoke, not that the resulting workloads are operationally healthy.

  Application and service health beyond delivery is outside OCM's core scope by design. OCM's role is to ensure the right resources reach the right clusters; verifying that a Deployment's pods are running, healthy, and serving traffic is the responsibility of the application layer or a dedicated monitoring addon.

  The addon framework is the natural extension point here: addons such as the policy addon can verify compliance and operational state of workloads across the fleet, with status rolled up via `ManagedClusterAddOn` conditions on the hub. Operators building on OCM typically layer application observability through addons deployed consistently across the fleet via ManifestWork.

* **How can an operator determine if the project is in use by workloads?**

  An operator can determine OCM is in active use by inspecting:
  - **`ManifestWork`** resources in cluster namespaces on the hub — each represents active work being dispatched to a spoke
  - **`AppliedManifestWork`** resources on the spoke — each confirms work has been applied and is being reconciled
  - **`ClusterManagementAddOn`** on the hub — lists which addons are enabled fleet-wide
  - **`ManagedClusterAddOn`** per cluster namespace — shows which addons are active per cluster

  Resources applied to spokes via ManifestWork carry an `ownerReference` back to their `AppliedManifestWork`. The work agent deliberately uses `ownerReference` rather than `controllerReference` to support shared ownership — multiple ManifestWorks can co-own a resource on the spoke. To audit OCM-managed resources on a spoke independently of the hub, match the full reference rather than the kind alone — `apiVersion: work.open-cluster-management.io/v1` together with a `uid` that resolves to an `AppliedManifestWork` actually present on that cluster. Matching on `kind: AppliedManifestWork` by itself can pick up unrelated resources or stale references left by a deleted owner. See [ManifestWork](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/concepts/manifestwork/).

* **How can someone using this project know that it is working for their instance?**

  The operator API, `ClusterManager` and `Klusterlet`, show the healthiness of the services.
  User can also run `clusteradm get hub-info` and `clusteradm get klusterlet-info` to get status of the hub
  cluster and the managed cluster.

* **Describe the SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for this project.**

  OCM defines the following SLOs:
  - **Cluster Availability**: 99.9% of managed clusters should be in "Available" status during business hours
  - **ManifestWork Success Rate**: 99.5% of ManifestWork deployments should succeed within 5 minutes
  - **Addon Availability**: 99% of enabled addons should be in "Available" status across all managed clusters
  - **Certificate Rotation**: 100% of certificate rotations should complete successfully before expiration
  - **Hub Recovery Time**: Hub cluster recovery should complete within 30 minutes in disaster scenarios

* **What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?**

  OCM's health indicators are expressed as Kubernetes status conditions on `ClusterManager`, `Klusterlet`, `ManagedCluster`, `ManifestWork`, and `ManagedClusterAddOn` resources rather than named Prometheus metrics. These are queryable via the Kubernetes API or via `clusteradm get hub-info` and `clusteradm get klusterlet-info`.

  For Prometheus-based alerting, operators can filter standard Kubernetes API server metrics to OCM resource types as described in [Monitoring OCM](https://open-cluster-management.io/docs/getting-started/administration/monitoring/). Where richer, named metrics are needed — for example, fleet-wide availability gauges or ManifestWork success rates — OCM's addon framework makes it straightforward to deploy a monitoring agent consistently across the fleet and roll up custom metrics to a central stack. The project's extensibility means operators are not limited to what ships in the core.

### Dependencies

* **Describe the specific running services the project depends on in the cluster.**

  The standard Kubernetes control plane dependencies (API server, etcd, kube-controller-manager) are prerequisites for any OCM deployment and are not unique to the project.

  The **CSR (Certificate Signing Request) API** is worth calling out explicitly as a non-obvious critical dependency of the default registration path. Registration is pluggable: the Klusterlet's `registrationDriver.authType` accepts `csr` (the default), `awsirsa`, or `grpc`. Under the default `csr` driver the spoke agent obtains a signed client certificate through the CSR API at registration and relies on it for automatic certificate rotation thereafter, so if the CSR API is unavailable or disabled, registration fails and rotation is blocked. Adopters on platforms where CSR-based signing is not available — EKS being the common case — can instead use the `awsirsa` driver, which registers via AWS IAM roles for service accounts, or the `grpc` driver. See [`RegistrationDriver`](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/api/blob/main/operator/v1/types_klusterlet.go).

  **[MORE INPUT NEEDED]** Are there other non-obvious service dependencies — for example, specific admission webhooks, feature gates that must be enabled, or minimum API group availability — that operators should know about before deploying OCM?

* **Describe the project's dependency lifecycle policy.**

  OCM follows a conservative dependency lifecycle policy:
  - Kubernetes dependencies are updated to the latest stable version with each OCM release
  - Go dependencies are updated monthly via Dependabot automated PRs for security patches
  - Major dependency upgrades are planned during quarterly releases with backward compatibility testing
  - Legacy dependencies are deprecated with a minimum 2-release migration period
  - Critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies trigger immediate patch releases
  - All dependency changes require approval from project maintainers and CI validation

* **How does the project incorporate and consider source composition analysis as part of its development and security hygiene? Describe how this source composition analysis (SCA) is tracked.**

  Dependabot and GitHub Security scanning automatically generate PRs for dependency and vulnerability updates. These PRs go through the same CI pipeline as any contribution — unit tests, integration tests, e2e — and require maintainer approval before merging. Critical security vulnerabilities trigger an immediate patch release; routine updates are batched monthly.

  SBOM generation is part of the release pipeline: every container image published to `quay.io/open-cluster-management` receives an SPDX-format SBOM generated via `anchore/sbom-action` and attested using GitHub's native artifact attestation (`actions/attest-sbom`), which signs keylessly through Sigstore and records the entry in the Rekor transparency log. The GitHub Security Dashboard is used to track open findings.

  Note that this attestation is the current signing mechanism for released images; the project does not presently publish a standalone detached image signature alongside each image.

* **Describe how the project implements changes based on source composition analysis (SCA) and the timescale.**

  Dependabot PRs for security patches are reviewed and merged on an ongoing basis; critical vulnerabilities trigger an immediate patch release. Routine dependency updates are batched monthly. All changes require CI validation and maintainer approval before merging.

### Troubleshooting

* **How does this project recover if a key component or feature becomes unavailable? e.g Kubernetes API server, etcd, database, leader node, etc.**

  When the hub becomes unavailable, managed clusters continue running the resources already applied to them — there is no immediate workload impact, because OCM's pull-based model means spokes do not depend on hub availability to keep serving existing work. Management itself is interrupted for the duration: no new or changed `ManifestWork` is delivered, existing work is not reconciled against hub state, and cluster and work status stop reporting until the agent can reach a hub again.

  OCM offers two distinct paths back, and they address different failure modes:

  - **Planned high availability** — the [MultipleHubs feature](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/tree/main/solutions/multiplehubs) lets a Klusterlet hold bootstrap kubeconfigs for several hubs configured in advance and move between them, including failing over when the current hub sets `hubAcceptsClient: false` or becomes unreachable, and failing back afterwards. This is an availability mechanism for hubs provisioned ahead of time; it is not a restore procedure.
  - **Hub rebuild** — where no standby hub exists, recovery means restoring the hub's OCM custom resource data (`ManagedCluster`, `ManifestWork`, `Placement`, addon resources) onto a new control plane and having Klusterlet agents re-establish registration against it. Beyond the CRs themselves this also involves the OCM CRDs, cluster namespaces, and the bootstrap credentials and certificates agents use to re-register.

  **[MORE INPUT NEEDED]** The project does not currently publish a tested end-to-end backup-and-restore runbook for the single-hub rebuild case, covering the full set of state above and verified agent reconnection against the restored hub. Maintainers should confirm whether such a procedure exists, and document and test it if not — enterprise adopters will expect one.

* **Describe the known failure modes.**

  Known failure modes in OCM include:
  - **Hub Cluster Failure**: Complete hub unavailability causes loss of centralized management, but managed clusters continue running existing workloads
  - **Network Partitions**: Spoke clusters unable to reach hub lose management capabilities until connectivity is restored
  - **Certificate Expiration**: Failed certificate rotation can break hub-spoke communication requiring manual intervention
  - **etcd Corruption**: Hub cluster data loss requires backup restoration and managed cluster re-registration
  - **Resource Exhaustion**: Too many clusters or ManifestWorks can overwhelm hub resources causing performance degradation
  - **API Server Overload**: High API request volume can cause timeouts and failed operations
  - **Addon Failures**: Individual addon crashes affect specific functionality but don't impact core cluster management

### Security

* **Security Hygiene**
    * **How is the project executing access control?**

      Open Cluster Management (OCM) employs a multi-layered approach to access control, ensuring secure and granular
      management of multi-cluster environments. This is primarily achieved through a combination of a double opt-in
      registration process, Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and specialized custom resources that streamline
      permission management across clusters.

      **Hub-Spoke Architecture and Secure Registration**

      At its core, OCM operates on a hub-spoke architecture, where a central hub cluster manages multiple spoke (managed)
      clusters. The initial and most critical access control measure is the secure registration of these spoke clusters
      to the hub. This is enforced through a double opt-in mechanism.

      This process requires explicit approval from administrators of both the hub and the spoke clusters. When a spoke
      cluster attempts to join the hub, a CertificateSigningRequest (CSR) is created on the hub. The hub administrator
      must approve this CSR, and concurrently, the spoke cluster administrator must apply the necessary configurations
      to initiate and accept the connection. This mutual agreement prevents unauthorized clusters from being added to
      the management domain.

      **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  
      OCM extensively leverages Kubernetes' native Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to define and enforce permissions
      for users and services operating within the multi-cluster environment. This is implemented through standard Kubernetes
      RBAC resources like Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, and ClusterRoleBindings.

      Specific roles are created by OCM to grant varying levels of access to different resources. For instance, there are
      predefined roles for cluster administration, application deployment, and policy management. Administrators can use
      these roles to control who can perform actions such as registering new clusters, deploying applications to specific
      clusters, or viewing cluster statuses.

      **ClusterPermission Custom Resource**

      To simplify the management of RBAC policies across a fleet of clusters, OCM introduces the ClusterPermission custom
      resource. This powerful feature allows administrators to define RBAC configurations (Roles, ClusterRoles, and their
      bindings) on the hub cluster and then automatically distribute and enforce them on selected managed clusters.
      This centralized approach ensures consistent permission settings and reduces the operational overhead of managing
      RBAC on each cluster individually.

      **ManagedServiceAccount for Service Identity**

      In conjunction with ClusterPermission, OCM utilizes the ManagedServiceAccount custom resource. This facilitates
      the management of service account identities across the managed clusters. By creating a ManagedServiceAccount on
      the hub, administrators can ensure that corresponding service accounts are created on the designated spoke clusters,
      simplifying authentication and authorization for applications and services that span multiple clusters.

      **Grouping and Isolation with ManagedClusterSet**

      OCM provides a mechanism to group managed clusters into logical sets called ManagedClusterSet. This is a key
      feature for implementing multi-tenancy and isolating access. By binding a ManagedClusterSet to a specific namespace
      on the hub cluster, administrators can restrict the permissions of users and applications to only the clusters within
      that set. This ensures that a user or service with access to one set of clusters cannot view or interact with clusters
      in another set, providing a strong security boundary.

      **Pull-Based Communication Model**

      A fundamental aspect of OCM's security posture is its pull-based communication model. The agent running on the managed
      clusters, known as the "klusterlet," actively pulls desired state configurations and workloads from the hub cluster.
      This means the hub cluster does not require direct network access or credentials to the API servers of the managed
      clusters. This design significantly reduces the attack surface and enhances the overall security of the multi-cluster environment.

* **Cloud Native Threat Modeling**
    * **How does the project ensure its security reporting and response team is representative of its community diversity (organizational and individual)?**

      OCM does not currently have a formal security reporting and response team structure separate from the maintainer team. 
      The project would benefit from establishing a dedicated security response team with diverse representation as it matures.
  
    * **How does the project invite and rotate security reporting team members?**

      Currently, OCM does not have a formal process for inviting and rotating security reporting team members as security
      responsibilities are handled by the general maintainer team.
